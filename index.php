<div class="header">Welcome To Chocopai.net</div>

  You've reached <a href="#">Shannon's</a> domain. This website - preceeded by many others - has hosted my websites and graphics since November 24, 2006.

  "Chocopai" is a rough (more cute than functional) transliteration of "쵸코파이" or "Choco Pie", a South Korean snackfood. I've always loved these dry marshmallowy snacks, despite how childish they are. As it turns out, a lot of things that make me happy are pretty childish. So I thought "chocopai" would be perfect for my domain name.
