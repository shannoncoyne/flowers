This is a site I created in 2008 to host my online portfolio. The layout was
drawn and designed in Photoshop, and then coded in a plain text editor.

What I like about this design is the mixing of gradients and flat aesthetics. I
think it's the design of mine I'd pick as ageing most gracefully.

On my to-do list for this layout is rewriting the HTML and CSS so that the
layout is not structured with tables. I'll also clean up the other pages.
